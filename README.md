## Overview

This project is a comprehensive solution for predicting sports ball types using machine learning. The model has been trained on a diverse dataset containing images of various sports balls, enabling it to accurately classify the type of ball in a given image.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: The model excels at classifying input images into different sports ball categories.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: The project includes a complete pipeline for model training, evaluation, and deployment for real-time predictions.

## Repository Structure

- `/data`: Contains the dataset used for training the model.
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `/src`: Source code for the machine learning model and any supporting scripts.
- `/models`: Directory for saving trained models.
- `/app`: Files for deploying the model using Hugging Face Gradio.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mr-Vicky-01/sports-ball-prediction-end-to-end.git
   cd sports-ball-prediction-end-to-end
